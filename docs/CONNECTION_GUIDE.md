# Adjustable Bed Connection Guide

This guide explains how to connect your adjustable bed to Home Assistant.

## Understanding Bluetooth Connectivity

Most adjustable beds use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with their remote controls and apps. This integration connects directly to your bed's BLE controller.

**Key Points:**
- **BLE Range**: Typically 10-30 meters, but walls and interference reduce this
- **Single Connection**: Most beds only accept ONE Bluetooth connection at a time - disconnect manufacturer apps first
- **Idle Disconnect**: The integration disconnects after 40 seconds of idle time to allow other devices to connect

### Beds Requiring Bluetooth Pairing

Some beds require OS-level Bluetooth pairing before the integration can communicate:

> **Understanding the table below:** The entries mix brand names, protocol variants, and generation names because manufacturers often use different communication protocols across their product lines. For example:
>
> - **Okimat/Okin** refers to Okimat-branded beds that use the Okin protocol (requires pairing).
> - **Leggett & Platt** appears in multiple rows because different models use different protocols/generations (Gen2, Okin variant, MlRM/WiLinke).
>
> To determine which row applies to your bed, check the label on your bed frame or controller, look at your remote's branding, or consult your manufacturer's manual.

| Bed Type | Pairing Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| Okimat/Okin | ✅ Yes |
| Leggett & Platt Okin variant | ✅ Yes |
| Leggett & Platt Gen2 | ❌ No |
| Leggett & Platt MlRM | ❌ No |
| Nectar | ❌ No |
| DewertOkin | ❌ No |
| All other beds | ❌ No |

**How to pair (if required):**
1. Put your bed in pairing mode (usually hold a button on the remote for 3-5 seconds)
2. On your Home Assistant host or phone, open Bluetooth settings
3. Pair with the bed (may appear as "OKIN", "Okimat", or similar)
4. Then add the integration in Home Assistant

**Note:** If you're using an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy, you may need to pair on the device running Home Assistant, not on your phone.

## Connection Methods

### *Method 1: ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy (Recommended)*

Use an ESP32 device running ESPHome as a Bluetooth proxy. This extends your Bluetooth range using WiFi.


**Pros:** Excellent range (place ESP32 near the bed), multiple proxies for whole-home coverage

**Cons:** Requires additional hardware (~$5-15)


### *Method 2: Local Bluetooth Adapter*

If your Home Assistant host has a Bluetooth adapter (built-in or USB dongle).


**Pros:** Simple setup, no additional hardware

**Cons:** Limited range, may not work if HA host is far from bed

## Setting Up an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy

1. **Get an ESP32 Board**
   - M5Stack Atom Lite (~$8)
   - ESP32-WROOM-32 DevKit (~$5)
   - ESP32-C3 Mini (~$4)

2. **Flash ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy Firmware**

   **Easy way:** Visit [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/), connect your ESP32 via USB, and follow the prompts.

   **Or use ESPHome Dashboard** with this configuration:

   ```yaml
   esphome:
     name: ble-proxy-bedroom
     friendly_name: Bedroom BLE Proxy

   esp32:
     board: esp32dev
     framework:
       type: esp-idf

   wifi:
     ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
     password: !secret wifi_password

   api:
     encryption:
       key: !secret api_encryption_key

   ota:
     - platform: esphome

   bluetooth_proxy:
     active: true

   esp32_ble_tracker:
     scan_parameters:
       active: true
   ```

3. **Place Near Your Bed** (within 5-10 meters, avoid metal obstructions)

4. **Add to Home Assistant** - The ESP32 should be auto-discovered in Settings → Devices & Services

---

## Adding Your Adjustable Bed

1. **Power on your bed** and disconnect any manufacturer apps or remove batteries from remotes

2. **Add the integration**: Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Adjustable Bed"

3. **Discovery or Manual Entry**
   - **Automatic:** Select your bed from the discovered list
   - **Manual:** Enter the Bluetooth MAC address (format: `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`) and select bed type

4. **Configure Settings**
   - **Name**: Friendly name for your bed
   - **Motor Count**: See below
   - **Has Massage**: Enable if your bed has massage
   - **Protocol Variant** (if available): Usually leave as "auto"
   - **Command Protocol** (Richmat only): Try different protocols if bed doesn't respond

---

## Advanced Options

After setup, you can adjust additional settings via **Settings → Integrations → Adjustable Bed → Configure** (gear icon):

- **Protocol variant** - Override if auto-detection fails
- **Motor pulse settings** - Fine-tune movement behavior
- **Bluetooth adapter** - Choose a specific adapter or proxy
- **Angle sensing** - Disable to allow physical remote to work (recommended)

See the [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed explanations of all options.

## Finding the Bluetooth Address

If your bed isn't auto-discovered:

**Using the Integration (Recommended):**
1. Go to Settings → Integrations → Add Integration → Adjustable Bed
2. Choose "Manual entry"
3. The integration displays all discovered Bluetooth devices with their MAC addresses
4. Find your bed in the list (look for names like "Desk XXXXX", "HHC...", your bed brand, etc.)

**Using ESPHome Logs:**
1. Open ESPHome dashboard → View logs for your proxy
2. Look for: `[bluetooth_proxy] Proxying packet from AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF...`

**Using nRF Connect (Fallback):**

If your bed doesn't appear in Home Assistant at all (not visible to any adapter or proxy), use [nRF Connect](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile) on your phone to verify the device exists and check its range. If nRF Connect sees it but Home Assistant doesn't, the bed may be out of range of your HA Bluetooth adapter - consider adding an ESPHome proxy closer to the bed.

**Tip:** If your bed type isn't recognized, you can add it in Diagnostic mode to capture BLE data. See [Getting Help](GETTING_HELP.md) for details.

## Motor Count Configuration

| Motors | Sections |
|--------|----------|
| 2 (most common) | Back + Legs |
| 3 | Head + Back + Legs |
| 4 | Head + Back + Legs + Feet |

**How to determine:** Count the distinct moving sections when using your remote, or check your bed's manual.
