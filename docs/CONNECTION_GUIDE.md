## Understanding Bluetooth Connectivity

Most smart beds use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with their remote controls and apps. This integration connects directly to your bed's BLE controller, giving you full control through Home Assistant.

### Key Points

1. **BLE Range**: Typical BLE range is 10-30 meters, but walls and interference can reduce this significantly
2. **Single Connection**: Most beds only accept ONE Bluetooth connection at a time. If the manufacturer's app is connected, Home Assistant won't be able to connect
3. **Connection Persistence**: The integration maintains a connection while in use and disconnects after 40 seconds of idle time to allow other devices to connect

## Connection Methods

### Method 1: Local Bluetooth Adapter

If your Home Assistant host has a Bluetooth adapter (built-in or USB dongle):

**Pros:**
- Simple setup
- No additional hardware needed

**Cons:**
- Limited range (depends on adapter and obstacles)
- May not work if HA host is far from bed

**Requirements:**
- Home Assistant OS, Supervised, or Container with Bluetooth access
- Bluetooth adapter supported by BlueZ
- Bed within Bluetooth range of HA host

### Method 2: ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy (Recommended)

Use an ESP32 device running ESPHome as a Bluetooth proxy. This extends your Bluetooth range using WiFi.

**Pros:**
- Excellent range (place ESP32 near the bed)
- Works seamlessly with HA's Bluetooth stack
- Multiple proxies for whole-home coverage

**Cons:**
- Requires additional hardware (~$5-15)
- Initial ESP32 setup required

**Requirements:**
- ESP32 development board (ESP32-WROOM, M5Stack Atom, etc.)
- ESPHome addon or CLI
- WiFi network

---

## Setup Instructions

### Setting Up an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy

1. **Get an ESP32 Board**

   Recommended boards:
   - M5Stack Atom Lite (~$8)
   - ESP32-WROOM-32 DevKit (~$5)
   - ESP32-C3 Mini (~$4)

2. **Flash ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy Firmware**

   **Option A: Web Installer (Easiest)**
   - Visit [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/)
   - Connect your ESP32 via USB
   - Click "Connect" and follow the prompts
   - Enter your WiFi credentials

   **Option B: ESPHome Dashboard**
   - Install ESPHome addon in Home Assistant
   - Create a new device with this configuration:

   ```yaml
   esphome:
     name: ble-proxy-bedroom
     friendly_name: Bedroom BLE Proxy

   esp32:
     board: esp32dev
     framework:
       type: esp-idf

   wifi:
     ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
     password: !secret wifi_password

   api:
     encryption:
       key: !secret api_encryption_key

   ota:
     platform: esphome

   logger:

   bluetooth_proxy:
     active: true

   esp32_ble_tracker:
     scan_parameters:
       active: true
   ```

3. **Place the ESP32 Near Your Bed**

   - Within 5-10 meters of the bed controller
   - Power via USB
   - Avoid metal obstructions between the proxy and bed

4. **Add to Home Assistant**

   - The ESP32 should be auto-discovered
   - Go to Settings → Devices & Services
   - Add the ESPHome device
   - **Important**: The ESPHome integration will now route Bluetooth traffic through the proxy

### Adding Your Smart Bed

1. **Power On Your Bed**

   - Ensure the bed controller has power
   - Disconnect any manufacturer apps (they may be holding the BLE connection)

2. **Add the Integration**

   - Go to Settings → Devices & Services
   - Click "+ Add Integration"
   - Search for "Smart Bed"

3. **Discovery or Manual Entry**

   **Automatic Discovery:**
   - If your bed is detected, you'll see it in the list
   - Select it and confirm

   **Manual Entry:**
   - Choose "Enter address manually"
   - Enter the Bluetooth MAC address (format: `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`)
   - Select the bed type

4. **Configure Settings**

   - **Name**: Friendly name for your bed
   - **Motor Count**: See [Motor Count Configuration](#motor-count-configuration)
   - **Has Massage**: Enable if your bed has massage functionality

## Identifying Your Bed

### Finding the Bluetooth Address

If your bed isn't auto-discovered, you need to find its BLE address.

**Method 1: nRF Connect App (Recommended)**

1. Install "nRF Connect" on your phone (iOS/Android)
2. Open the app and start scanning
3. Look for devices with names like:
   - `Desk XXXXX` (Linak beds)
   - `YOURBED` or similar
4. Note the MAC address

**Method 2: Home Assistant Bluetooth Scanner**

1. Go to Developer Tools → Services
2. Call `bluetooth.start_scan`
3. Check the logs for discovered devices

**Method 3: ESPHome Logs**

If you have an ESPHome proxy:

1. Open ESPHome dashboard
2. View logs for your proxy
3. Look for BLE advertisements:
   ```
   [bluetooth_proxy] Proxying packet from AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF...
   ```

### Identifying Beds by Brand

**Linak beds:**
- Device names often start with "Desk" (e.g., "Desk 12345")
- Service UUID: `99fa0001-338a-1024-8a49-009c0215f78a`

**MotoSleep beds:**
- Device names start with "HHC" (e.g., "HHC3611243CDEF")
- Service UUID: `0000ffe0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

**Richmat beds:**
- Nordic variant: Service UUID `6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`
- WiLinke variant: Various UUIDs starting with `8ebd4f76-...` or `0000fee9-...`

**Leggett & Platt beds:**
- Gen2: Service UUID `45e25100-3171-4cfc-ae89-1d83cf8d8071`
- Okin: Service UUID `62741523-52f9-8864-b1ab-3b3a8d65950b`

**Reverie beds:**

**Okimat beds:**
- Service UUID: `62741523-52f9-8864-b1ab-3b3a8d65950b` (same as Leggett Okin)
- Requires BLE pairing before use

## Motor Count Configuration

Different bed models have different numbers of motors:

### 2-Motor Beds (Most Common)
- **Back/Upper Body**: Raises the upper portion
- **Legs**: Raises the leg portion

### 3-Motor Beds
- **Head**: Independent head tilt
- **Back**: Upper body support
- **Legs**: Leg elevation

### 4-Motor Beds
- **Head**: Independent head tilt
- **Back**: Upper body support
- **Legs**: Knee/thigh elevation
- **Feet**: Foot elevation

### How to Determine Motor Count

1. **Count the moving sections**: Press your remote's buttons and count distinct movements
2. **Check your bed's manual**: Should specify the number of motors
3. **Look at the controller**: May have labels for each motor

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.smartbed: debug
    homeassistant.components.bluetooth: debug
    bleak: debug
```

Restart Home Assistant and check the logs.

### Common Issues

#### "Device not found"

**Symptoms:**
- Integration can't find the bed
- Logs show "Device X not found in Bluetooth scanner"

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure bed is powered on
2. Disconnect manufacturer app
3. Check Bluetooth adapter/proxy is working
4. Move proxy closer to bed
5. Verify the MAC address is correct

#### "Failed to connect"

**Symptoms:**
- Device is found but connection fails
- Logs show BLE connection errors

**Solutions:**
1. Power cycle the bed controller
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Check if another device is connected to the bed
4. Update ESPHome proxy firmware

#### "Commands not working"

**Symptoms:**
- Connected but bed doesn't respond
- Logs show commands being sent

**Solutions:**
1. Verify correct bed type is selected
2. Check motor count configuration
3. Try pressing physical remote to "wake" the bed
4. Check for firmware updates on bed controller

#### "Position sensors not updating"

**Symptoms:**
- Connected and commands work
- Angle sensors stay at 0 or unknown

**Cause:**
Not all beds support position feedback. This requires specific GATT characteristics that some controllers don't implement.

**Solutions:**
1. This may be normal for your bed model
2. Check logs for "Position notifications unavailable" messages

### ESPHome Proxy Issues

#### "Already connected to another client"

This was a major issue with the old smartbed-mqtt addon. This new integration uses Home Assistant's native Bluetooth stack, which handles ESPHome proxies correctly.

If you're still having issues:
1. Ensure you're using ESPHome 2024.1.0 or later
2. Update the Bluetooth Proxy to the latest version
3. Don't add multiple Bluetooth integrations for the same proxy
