## Connection Issues

### "Failed to connect to bed"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Bed is powered off or in standby mode
2. Another device is already connected (phone app, another HA instance)
3. Bed is out of Bluetooth range
4. Bluetooth adapter issues

**Solutions:**
1. **Power cycle the bed:** Unplug the bed's power for 30 seconds, then plug it back in
2. **Close other apps:** Close any phone apps that might be connected to the bed
3. **Move adapter closer:** If using a USB Bluetooth adapter, try moving it closer to the bed
4. **Use a Bluetooth proxy:** Consider using an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy placed near the bed
5. **Check Bluetooth adapter:** Verify your Bluetooth adapter is working with other devices

### "Connection timed out"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Weak Bluetooth signal
2. Interference from other devices
3. Bed controller is busy

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce distance:** Move Bluetooth adapter or proxy closer to the bed
2. **Remove interference:** Move away from WiFi routers, microwaves, or other 2.4GHz devices
3. **Wait and retry:** Wait a minute and try again - the bed may have been processing a command

### "Device not found"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Bed is not advertising BLE services
2. Wrong MAC address configured
3. Bed type not supported

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify BLE advertising:** Use a BLE scanner app to confirm the bed is visible
2. **Check MAC address:** Verify the MAC address matches what's shown in your BLE scanner
3. **Try manual configuration:** Use manual setup if auto-discovery doesn't find the bed

## Commands Not Working

### Bed doesn't respond to commands

**Possible Causes:**
1. Wrong protocol variant selected
2. Connection was silently dropped
3. Command format incompatible with your bed

**Solutions:**
1. **Try a different variant:** Go to integration options and try a different protocol variant
   - Keeson: Try "base" vs "ksbt"
   - Leggett & Platt: Try "gen2" vs "okin"
   - Richmat: Try "nordic" vs "wilinke"
2. **Reconnect:** Press the "Connect" button or restart the integration
3. **Check diagnostics:** Download diagnostics and verify the controller type matches your bed

### Some commands work, others don't

**Possible Causes:**
1. Feature not supported by your bed model
2. Wrong motor count configured
3. Massage not enabled in config

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify features:** Check if your bed actually has the feature (massage, lights, etc.)
2. **Update motor count:** Set correct number of motors in options (2, 3, or 4)
3. **Enable massage:** If bed has massage, enable it in integration options

### Commands are slow or delayed

**Possible Causes:**
1. Weak Bluetooth connection
2. Many commands queued
3. Bed controller processing

**Solutions:**
1. **Improve signal:** Move Bluetooth adapter/proxy closer to the bed
2. **Use stop button:** Press "Stop All" before sending new commands
3. **Wait between commands:** Allow a few seconds between commands

## Position Feedback Issues

### Position sensors show "Unknown" or don't update

**Possible Causes:**
1. Angle sensing is disabled (recommended setting)
2. Bed doesn't support position feedback
3. Notification subscription failed

**Solutions:**
1. **Check settings:** Position feedback is disabled by default to prevent remote conflicts
2. **Enable angle sensing:** If you want position data, disable "Disable angle sensing" in options
3. **Note:** Most beds except Linak don't support position feedback

### Position values seem incorrect

**Possible Causes:**
1. Calibration differences between beds
2. Position data interpretation varies by model

**Solutions:**
1. **Use as relative indicators:** Position values are most useful for relative positioning
2. **Note:** Exact angles may vary between bed models

## Physical Remote Conflicts

### Physical remote stops working when HA is connected

**This is expected behavior.** Most BLE beds only support one connection at a time.

**Solutions:**
1. **Enable "Disable angle sensing":** This is the default and recommended setting
2. **Use HA controls:** Use Home Assistant instead of the physical remote
3. **Press "Disconnect" button:** Manually disconnect HA to use the physical remote
4. **Idle timeout:** HA automatically disconnects after 40 seconds of inactivity

### Remote works but bed doesn't respond to HA afterward

**Possible Causes:**
1. Remote took over the connection
2. Connection state is stale

**Solutions:**
1. **Press "Connect" button:** Force a reconnection from Home Assistant
2. **Restart integration:** Reload the integration from Settings > Integrations

---

## Protocol/Variant Issues

### Wrong bed type detected

**Possible Causes:**
1. Bed shares UUIDs with another type
2. OEM bed using different manufacturer's controller

**Solutions:**
1. **Manual configuration:** Remove and re-add the bed using manual setup
2. **Try different types:** If one type doesn't work, try related types (e.g., Okimat ↔ Leggett Okin)

### Keeson Variant Selection

| Symptom | Try This Variant |
|---------|------------------|
| Member's Mark, Purple, ErgoMotion beds | Base (BaseI4/BaseI5) |
| Older Keeson beds, Nordic UART | KSBT |
| Commands partially work | Try the other variant |

### Leggett & Platt Variant Selection

| Symptom | Try This Variant |
|---------|------------------|
| Most L&P beds, text-based commands | Gen2 |
| Pairing required, Okin remote | Okin |
| RGB lighting available | Gen2 (only one with RGB) |

### Richmat Variant Selection

| Symptom | Try This Variant |
|---------|------------------|
| Simple single-byte commands | Nordic |
| 5-byte commands with checksum | WiLinke |
| Auto-detect fails | Try Nordic first, then WiLinke |

## Pairing Required (Okimat/Leggett Okin)

Some beds require Bluetooth pairing before they can be controlled.

### How to Pair

1. **On Linux/Raspberry Pi:**
   ```bash
   bluetoothctl
   scan on
   # Find your bed's MAC address
   pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
   trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
   ```

2. **On Home Assistant OS:**
   - Use the Bluetooth adapter's built-in pairing (if supported)
   - Or pair from another device first, then transfer

3. **On Windows/macOS (for testing):**
   - Go to Bluetooth settings
   - Find the bed and click "Pair"

### Signs Pairing is Needed
- Connection succeeds but no commands work
- Bed shows in BLE scan but won't connect
- "Pairing required" error message

## Getting Help

### Before Asking for Help

1. **Check logs:** Look at Home Assistant logs for error messages
   - Settings → System → Logs → Filter by "smartbed"

2. **Download diagnostics:**
   - Settings → Integrations → Smart Bed → ⋮ → Download diagnostics
   - This includes config and connection info (MAC address is redacted)

3. **Test with BLE scanner:**
   - Use an app like "nRF Connect" to verify your bed is advertising
   - Note the service UUIDs - these help identify the correct bed type

### Information to Include in Bug Reports

1. Bed brand and model (if known)
2. Diagnostics file (downloaded from HA)
3. Relevant log entries
4. What you tried and what happened
5. Screenshots of any error messages

### Where to Get Help

- **GitHub Issues:** [ha-smartbed/issues](https://github.com/kristofferR/ha-smartbed/issues)
- **Home Assistant Community:** Search for "smart bed" discussions
