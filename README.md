<details>
<summary><b>Quick troubleshooting</b></summary>

1. **Check range** - Bluetooth adapter or proxy within ~10m of bed
2. **Disconnect other apps** - Most beds allow only one BLE connection
3. **Reload integration** - Settings → Devices & Services → Adjustable Bed → Reload
4. **Enable debug logs** - Add to `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     logs:
       custom_components.adjustable_bed: debug
   ```

**Have one of these?** [Let us know](https://github.com/kristofferR/ha-adjustable-bed/issues) how well it works!

## Will This Work With My Bed?

**Just try it!** The integration auto-detects most beds. Install it and see if your bed shows up.

**Didn't auto-detect?** Check the [Supported Actuators guide](docs/SUPPORTED_ACTUATORS.md) to find your bed's actuator brand, then add it manually.

**Still stuck?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/kristofferR/ha-adjustable-bed/issues) with your bed brand/model and we'll help!

**Other beds:** [Eight Sleep](https://github.com/lukas-clarke/eight_sleep) and [Sleep Number](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sleepiq/) have their own integrations. Cloud-based beds (Tempur Ergo, BeautyRest with Sleeptracker AI) aren't supported yet.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Search for "Adjustable Bed"
3. Click Install
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/adjustable_bed` to your `config/custom_components/` directory and restart.

## Configuration

Your bed should auto-discover via Bluetooth. If not:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for "Adjustable Bed"
3. Enter your bed's Bluetooth address or select from discovered devices

To adjust settings after setup, click the **gear icon** on your device in Settings → Devices & Services.

<details>
<summary><b>Quick reference</b></summary>

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Motor Count | 2 (back/legs), 3 (adds head), or 4 (adds feet) |
| Has Massage | Enable if your bed has massage |
| Protocol Variant | Usually auto-detected, override if needed |
| Motor Pulse Settings | Fine-tune movement timing |
| Disable Angle Sensing | Keep on to allow physical remote to work |
| Octo PIN | 4-digit PIN for Octo beds that require authentication |
| Richmat Remote | Remote model code for Richmat beds |

See the [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for all options.

</details>

## Bluetooth Setup

Works with Home Assistant's native Bluetooth:
- **Local adapter** on your HA host
- **[ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html)** for extended range

See the [Connection Guide](docs/CONNECTION_GUIDE.md) for setup help.

## Contributing

**We'd love your help!** This integration is actively developed and we're especially looking for:

- **Testers** - Own a bed we haven't fully tested? Your feedback is invaluable
- **Bug reports** - Found something wrong? [Open an issue](https://github.com/kristofferR/ha-adjustable-bed/issues)
- **Code contributions** - PRs welcome!

<details>
<summary><b>Adding support for a new bed type</b></summary>

1. Capture BLE traffic using nRF Connect or similar
2. Document the GATT services and characteristics
3. Implement a controller in `beds/`
4. Add detection to `config_flow.py`

See [Supported Actuators](docs/SUPPORTED_ACTUATORS.md) for protocol documentation.

## Credits

Massive thanks to the [smartbed-mqtt](https://github.com/richardhopton/smartbed-mqtt) developers for their pioneering work reverse-engineering bed protocols!

<details>
<summary><b>Migrating from smartbed-mqtt?</b></summary>

This integration replaces smartbed-mqtt with several advantages:
- Uses Home Assistant's native Bluetooth (no ESPHome API issues)
- Works seamlessly with ESPHome Bluetooth proxies
- No MQTT broker required
- Native HA entities

To migrate: Install this integration, configure your bed, verify it works, then remove smartbed-mqtt.
