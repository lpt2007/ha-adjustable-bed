This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Home Assistant custom integration for controlling smart adjustable beds via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It replaces the broken `smartbed-mqtt` addon with a native HA integration that uses Home Assistant's Bluetooth stack directly, avoiding the ESPHome Native API compatibility issues that broke the old addon.

**Current status:** Linak beds fully implemented. Other bed types (Richmat, Solace, MotoSleep, Reverie, etc.) are planned but not yet implemented.

## Why the Old Integration Broke

The `smartbed-mqtt` addon (in the `smartbed-mqtt/` folder) broke due to:

1. **ESPHome 2023.6.0+**: BLE proxy became single-client only - HA's ESPHome integration would block smartbed-mqtt from receiving BLE advertisements
2. **ESPHome 2025.5.0+**: New Native API messages (especially `BluetoothScannerStateResponse` id 126) crash the `@2colors/esphome-native-api` JS library

See `smartbed-mqtt-discord-chats/esphome-bug-llm-generated.md` for detailed documentation.

**The new integration solves this** by using HA's native Bluetooth stack (bleak) instead of ESPHome's Native API.

### Key Components

**SmartBedCoordinator** (`coordinator.py`): Central BLE connection manager
- Handles device discovery via HA's Bluetooth integration
- Connection retry with progressive backoff (3 attempts, 5-7.5s delays)
- Auto-disconnect after idle (60s with angle sensing, 45s without)
- Registers conservative BLE connection parameters (30-50ms intervals)
- Supports preferred adapter selection for multi-proxy setups
- Command serialization via `_command_lock` prevents concurrent BLE writes
- `async_execute_controller_command()`: All entities use this for proper locking
- `async_stop_command()`: Cancels running command, acquires lock, then sends STOP
- Disconnect timer is cancelled during commands to prevent mid-command disconnects
- `_intentional_disconnect` flag prevents auto-reconnect after manual/idle disconnect

**BedController** (`beds/base.py`): Abstract interface all bed types must implement
- `write_command(command, repeat_count, repeat_delay_ms, cancel_event)`: Send command bytes
- `start_notify()` / `stop_notify()`: Position notification handling
- `read_positions()`: Read current motor positions
- Motor control methods: `move_head_up()`, `move_back_down()`, `move_legs_stop()`, etc.
- Preset methods: `preset_memory()`, `program_memory()`
- Optional features: `lights_on()`, `massage_toggle()`, etc.

**Config Flow** (`config_flow.py`):
- Automatic discovery via BLE service UUIDs
- Manual entry with bed type selection
- Per-device Bluetooth adapter/proxy selection

## Adding a New Bed Type

1. **Document the BLE protocol** - Use nRF Connect or similar to capture GATT services, characteristics, and command bytes

2. **Add constants to `const.py`**:
   ```python
   BED_TYPE_RICHMAT: Final = "richmat"
   RICHMAT_CONTROL_SERVICE_UUID: Final = "..."
   RICHMAT_CONTROL_CHAR_UUID: Final = "..."
   ```

3. **Create controller in `beds/`** (e.g., `richmat.py`):
   - Extend `BedController`
   - Implement all abstract methods
   - Define command bytes as a class (see `LinakCommands`)

4. **Add detection to `config_flow.py`** in `detect_bed_type()`:
   ```python
   if RICHMAT_CONTROL_SERVICE_UUID.lower() in service_uuids:
       return BED_TYPE_RICHMAT
   ```

5. **Update `coordinator.py`** `_create_controller()`:
   ```python
   if self._bed_type == BED_TYPE_RICHMAT:
       from .beds.richmat import RichmatController
       return RichmatController(self)
   ```

6. **Uncomment in `const.py`** `SUPPORTED_BED_TYPES` list

7. **Add to `manifest.json`** `bluetooth` array if using different service UUID for discovery

## Linak BLE Protocol Reference

```
Control Service:   99fa0001-338a-1024-8a49-009c0215f78a
  Write Char:      99fa0002-338a-1024-8a49-009c0215f78a
  Write Mode:      WITH RESPONSE (response=True) - bed expects acknowledgment

Command format: [command_byte, 0x00]

Motor commands:
  0x0B/0x0A = back up/down
  0x09/0x08 = legs up/down
  0x03/0x02 = head up/down
  0x05/0x04 = feet up/down
  0x00 = stop all

Motor timing:
  - 50 repeats at 100ms intervals (5 seconds total movement)
  - ALWAYS send STOP (0x00) after movement - use try/finally pattern

Presets:
  0x0E, 0x0F, 0x0C, 0x44 = Memory 1-4
  0x38, 0x39, 0x3A, 0x45 = Program Memory 1-4

Preset timing:
  - 100 repeats at 300ms intervals (30 seconds for full preset movement)
  - NO stop command needed after presets

Single-shot commands (1 write, no repeat):
  - Lights: 0x92 (on), 0x93 (off), 0x94 (toggle)
  - Program memory: 0x38-0x3A, 0x45
  - Massage controls: all massage commands

Position Service: 99fa0020-338a-1024-8a49-009c0215f78a
  Back:  99fa0028 (max 820 raw = 68°)
  Legs:  99fa0027 (max 548 raw = 45°)
  Head:  99fa0026 (3+ motors)
  Feet:  99fa0025 (4 motors)

Position data format:
  - Little-endian 16-bit: raw = data[0] | (data[1] << 8)
  - Angle = max_angle * (raw / max_raw)
```

## Critical Implementation Details

These details were discovered by comparing with the working smartbed-mqtt implementation:

1. **Write with response** - Use `response=True` for all GATT writes. The bed expects write-with-response.

2. **Always send STOP after movement** - Movement methods use `try/finally` to guarantee STOP is sent even if cancelled. The STOP command uses a fresh `asyncio.Event()` so it's not affected by the cancel signal.

3. **Command serialization** - All entities must use `coordinator.async_execute_controller_command()` instead of calling controller methods directly. This ensures proper locking and prevents concurrent BLE writes.

4. **Cancel event handling** - `write_command()` checks `coordinator._cancel_command` by default. When stop is requested, the cancel event is set, the running command exits early, then STOP is sent.

5. **Disconnect timer management** - Timer is cancelled when a command starts (inside the lock) and reset when it ends. This prevents mid-command disconnects for long operations.

6. **Presets are long operations** - 100 repeats × 300ms = 30 seconds. Idle timeout must be >30s (currently 45s when angle sensing disabled).

7. **Intentional disconnect flag** - Set before `client.disconnect()`, checked in `_on_disconnect` to skip auto-reconnect. Cleared in finally block since callback may not fire on clean disconnects.

## Integration Features

- **Options Flow** - Reconfigure bed settings without deleting the integration
- **Diagnostics** - Download debug info from Settings > Devices > Smart Bed
- **Custom Services** - `smartbed.goto_preset`, `smartbed.save_preset`, `smartbed.stop_all`
- **Auto-reconnection** - Automatically reconnects after unexpected disconnections
- **MAC Validation** - Validates Bluetooth address format during manual setup

## Development

### Testing in Home Assistant

1. Copy `custom_components/smartbed` to your HA's `config/custom_components/`
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add debug logging to `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.smartbed: debug
       homeassistant.components.bluetooth: debug
   ```

### Key Configuration Options

- **motor_count**: 2, 3, or 4 motors
- **has_massage**: Enable massage button entities
- **disable_angle_sensing**: Default `true` - keeps physical remote working
- **preferred_adapter**: Lock device to specific ESPHome proxy

### Common Issues

- **Commands timeout**: Another device (app/remote) may be connected - beds only allow one BLE connection
- **Position sensing breaks physical remote**: Enable `disable_angle_sensing` option
- **Connection drops**: Move ESP32 proxy closer to bed, check for interference
